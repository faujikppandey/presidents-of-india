                        Giri was born in Berhampur, Odisha to a Telugu-speaking Niyogi Brahmin[5] family. His father, V.
                        V. Jogayya Pantulu, was a successful lawyer and political activist of the Indian National
                        Congress.[6] Giri's mother Subhadramma was active in the national movement in Berhampur during
                        the Non Cooperation and Civil Disobedience Movements and was arrested for leading a strike for
                        prohibition during the Civil Disobedience Movement.[7]

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Giri was married to Saraswati Bai and the couple had 14 children.[8]

                        Giri completed his initial education at the Khallikote College, then affiliated with Utkal
                        University, in Berhampur.[9] In 1913 he went to Ireland to study law which he did at University
                        College Dublin and the Honourable Society of King's Inns, Dublin between 1913–1916.[10] Giri was
                        one among the first crop of thirteen Indian students who sat the obligatory year long course at
                        UCD in 1914–15. This was a requirement for being called to the Irish Bar through study at the
                        King's Inns. In total, 50 Indian students studied at UCD between 1914 and 1917.[11]

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Giri and a fellow law student also enrolled to study on the full bachelor of arts course in UCD.
                        Giri studied English, where he was lectured by Thomas MacDonagh, and Political Economy. His
                        lecturer in political economy was the reformer and co-operativist Thomas A. Finlay SJ.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        During the First World War, Giri travelled from Dublin to London and met with Mahatma
                        Gandhi.[11] Gandhi wanted for Giri to join the Imperial war effort as a Red Cross Volunteer.
                        Giri initially acceded to Gandhi's request but later regretted his decision. According to one of
                        Giri's biographers, "Gandhiji with his characteristic magnanimity relieved Giri of the
                        obligation to join the Red Cross and did not breathe a word about it to anyone.”[12]

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Giri was active in both Indian and Irish politics during his studies. Along with fellow Indian
                        students he produced a pamphlet documenting the abuse of Indians in South Africa. The pamphlet
                        was intercepted by Indian Political Intelligence and resulted in increased police scrutiny of
                        Giri and his fellow students in Dublin.[11] Meanwhile, anonymous articles were written by Indian
                        students for the newspaper of the Irish Volunteers and in The National Student, a UCD student
                        magazine.[13]

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        He was suspected of association with prominent ring leaders in the 1916 Rising including James
                        Connolly, PH Pearse and the young Éamon de Valera.[14][15][16] Giri was called to the Irish Bar
                        on 21 June 1916 but he did not complete his studies for BA in UCD.[13] Indian students were
                        subjected to police raids following the 1916 Rising and Giri recounts how he was served with one
                        month's notice to leave Ireland on 1 June 1916.

                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Giri was sworn in as President of India on 24 August 1969 and held office till 24 August 1974
                        when he was succeeded by Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed.[72] On his election, Giri became the only
                        president to have also been an acting president and the only person to be elected president as
                        an independent candidate.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As president, Giri unquestioningly accepted Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's decision to sack the
                        Charan Singh ministry in Uttar Pradesh and advised her to go in for early elections in 1971.[73]
                        The ordinance abolishing privy purses and privileges of the erstwhile rulers of India's princely
                        states was promulgated by Giri after the government's original amendment was defeated in the
                        Rajya Sabha.[74] His advice to Prime Minister Gandhi against the appointement of A.N. Ray as the
                        Chief Justice of India superseding three judges senior to him was ignored by her as was his
                        warning that a crackdown on striking railwaymen would only exacerbate the situation.[75][76] As
                        president, Giri made 14 state visits to 22 countries in South and South East Asia, Europe and
                        Africa.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Giri is regarded as a president who completely subordinated himself to the prime minister and
                        has been described as a "Prime Minister’s President",[79] a loyalist president and a rubber
                        stamp president under whom the independence of the office eroded.[80][81][82] When Giri's term
                        ended in 1974, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi chose not to renominate him to the presidency and
                        instead chose Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, who was elected in the presidential election of 1974.
