                        He was born in Sandhwan, Faridkot district on 5 May 1916 to Kishan Singh. He was named Jarnail,
                        meaning “General”, but as a young man, he changed his first name to Zail after being imprisoned
                        several times for opposing the rule of the maharajah of Faridkot.[2] He was a Sikh by religion,
                        was given the title of Giani, as he was educated and learned about Guru Granth Sahib at Shaheed
                        Sikh Missionary College in Amritsar.[4]

                        Zail Singh was elected as a Congress Chief Minister of Punjab in 1972.[7] He arranged massive
                        religious gatherings, started public functions with a traditional Sikh prayer, inaugurated a
                        highway named after Guru Gobind Singh, and named a township after the Guru's son.[8] He created
                        a lifelong pension scheme for the freedom fighters of the state. He repatriated the remains of
                        Udham Singh from London, armaments and articles belonging to Guru Gobind Singh.

                        In 1982, he was unanimously nominated to serve as the President. Nonetheless, some in the media
                        felt that the President had been chosen for being an Indira loyalist rather than an eminent
                        person. "If my leader had said I should pick up a broom and be a sweeper, I would have done
                        that. She chose me to be President," Singh was quoted to have said after his election.[9] He
                        took the oath of office on 25 July 1982. He was the first Sikh to hold the office.

                        He served beside Gandhi and protocol dictated that he should be briefed every week by her on the
                        affairs of the state. On 31 May 1984, day before Operation Blue Star, he met with Gandhi for
                        more than an hour, but she omitted even sharing a word about her plan.[10] Following the
                        operation he was pressured to resign from his post by Sikhs. He decided against resignation
                        fearing to aggravate the situation on advice from Yogi Bhajan. He was subsequently called before
                        the Akal Takhat to apologize and explain his inaction at the desecration of the Harimandir Sahib
                        and killing of innocent Sikhs. Indira Gandhi was assassinated on 31 October in the same year,
                        and he appointed her elder son Rajiv Gandhi as Prime Minister.[11]

                        Zail Singh was awarded the Order of St. Thomas[12] (the highest honorary award conferred by the
                        Indian Orthodox Church) by Catholicos of the East Baselios MarThoma Mathews I during the
                        Catholicate Platinum jubilee celebratory meeting held at Kottayam Nehru Stadium on 12 September
                        1982.
