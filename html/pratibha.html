                        Election
                        Main article: 2007 Indian presidential election
                        Patil was announced as the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) candidate on 14 June 2007. She
                        emerged as a compromise candidate after the left-wing parties of the alliance would not agree to
                        the nomination of former Home Minister Shivraj Patil or Karan Singh.[9] Patil had been loyal to
                        the INC and the Nehru–Gandhi family for decades and this was considered to be a significant
                        factor in her selection by INC leader Sonia Gandhi, although Patil said that she had no
                        intention of being a "rubber-stamp president".[6][10]

                        In the same month that she was selected, as the member of the UPA Patil was accused of shielding
                        her brother, G. N. Patil, in the 2005 Vishram Patil murder case. Vishram Patil had narrowly
                        defeated G. N. Patil in an election to be the President of the District Congress Committee of
                        Jalgaon and in September of that year had been murdered. Vishram Patil's widow eventually
                        accused G. N. Patil of involvement in the crime and claimed that Pratibha Patil had influenced
                        the criminal investigation and that the issue needed to be examined before presidential immunity
                        became active.[11] Her accusations were rejected by the courts in 2009[12] but in 2015 G. N.
                        Patil was charged. No reference to the alleged involvement of Pratibha Patil was made at this
                        time.[13]

                        Due to the presidential role being largely a figurehead position, the selection of candidate is
                        often arranged by consensus among the various political parties and the candidate runs
                        unopposed.[14] Contrary to the normal pattern of events, Patil faced a challenge in the
                        election. The BBC described the situation as "the latest casualty of the country's increasingly
                        partisan politics and [it] highlights what is widely seen as an acute crisis of leadership". It
                        "degenerated into unseemly mud slinging between the ruling party and the opposition".[15] Her
                        challenger was Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, the incumbent vice-president and a Bharatiya Janata
                        Party (BJP) veteran. Shekhawat stood as an independent candidate and was supported by the
                        National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a group led by the BJP,[16] although the Shiv Sena party,
                        which was a part of NDA, supported her because of her Marathi origin.[17]

                        Those opposed to Patil becoming president claimed that she lacked charisma, experience and
                        ability. They also highlighted her time spent away from high-level politics and queried her
                        belief in the supernatural, such as her claim to have received a message from Dada Lekhraj, a
                        dead guru.[6][15][18] Various specific issues were raised, such as a comment made by her in 1975
                        that those suffering from hereditary diseases should be sterilised.[6] Another alleged that
                        while a Member of Parliament for Amravati she diverted Rs 3.6 million from her MPLADS fund to a
                        trust run by her husband. This was in violation of Government rules which barred MPs from
                        providing funds to organisations run by their relatives.[19] The parliamentary affairs minister
                        denied any wrongdoing on Patil's part, and noted that the funds utilized under MPLADS are
                        audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.[20]

                        Patil won the election held on 19 July 2007. She garnered nearly two-thirds of the votes[21] and
                        took office as India's first woman president on 25 July 2007.[2]

                        President Patil speaking at the Doon School's Platinum Jubilee in October 2010.
                        Patil's term as the President of India saw various controversies.[22] She commuted death
                        sentences of 35 petitioners to life, a record. President's Office, however, defended this by
                        saying that President had granted clemency to the petitioners after due consideration and
                        examining the advice of the Home Ministry.[23][24]

                        <br>
                        Patil was noted for having spent more money on foreign trips, and having taken a greater number
                        of foreign trips, than any previous president.[25] Sometimes accompanied by as many as 11
                        members of her family, there had been 12 foreign trips spanning 22 countries by May 2012, when
                        she was away on her 13th trip. Those completed travels had cost Rs 205 crore (Rs 2.05 billion).
                        The Ministry of External Affairs said that taking family members "was not abnormal".[26]

                        The Office of President has a five-year term[15] and Patil retired from the role in July
                        2012.[27]

                        Patil allegedly used public funds to build a retirement mansion on a 260,000 square feet (24,000
                        m2) plot of military land in Pune.Tradition is that a retiring president either takes residence
                        in Government accommodation in Delhi or moves back to their residence in their home state;her
                        use of government money to build a retirement home at the end of the presidential term was
                        unprecedented.[28] Other controversies that arose after her retirement included her desire to
                        claim both an official government car and fuel allowance for the running of a private car,
                        despite rules clearly stipulating that this was an either/or situation. She also took possession
                        of many gifts that had been given to her in her official role and was later forced to return
                        them.[29]

                        Business interests
                        Patil set up Vidya Bharati Shikshan Prasarak Mandal, an educational institute which runs a chain
                        of schools and colleges in Amravati, Jalgaon, Pune and Mumbai. She also set up Shram Sadhana
                        Trust, which runs hostels for working women in New Delhi, Mumbai and Pune; and an engineering
                        college for rural students in Jalgaon district.[30] She also co-founded a cooperative sugar
                        factory known as Sant Muktabai Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana at Muktainagar.[31]

                        In addition, Patil founded a cooperative bank, Pratibha Mahila Sahakari Bank, that ceased
                        trading in February 2003 when its licence was cancelled by the Reserve Bank of India. Among
                        other failings, the bank had given illegal loans to her relatives that exceeded the bank's share
                        capital. It had also given a loan to her sugar mill which was never repaid. The bank waived
                        these loans, and this drove it into liquidation. The government liquidator of the bank, P. D.
                        Nigam, said, "The fact that relatives of the founder chairperson (Pratibha Patil) were among
                        those indiscriminately granted loans and that some illegal loan waivers were done has come up in
                        our audit." Six of the top ten defaulters in the bank were linked to her relatives. The INC
                        claimed that Patil had not been involved with the bank since 1994 but The Indian Express
                        reported that it had official documents showing her involvement as late as 2002.[32][33]
