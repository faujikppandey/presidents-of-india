                        Neelam Sanjiva Reddy About this soundpronunciation (help·info) (19 May 1913 – 1 June 1996) was
                        the sixth President of India, serving from 1977 to 1982. Beginning a long political career with
                        the Indian National Congress Party in the Indian independence movement, he went on to hold
                        several key offices in independent India—as the first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, a
                        two-time Speaker of the Lok Sabha and a Union Minister—before becoming the youngest-ever Indian
                        president.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Born in present-day Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, Reddy completed his schooling at Adayar
                        and joined the Government Arts College at Anantapur. He quit to become an Indian independence
                        activist and was jailed for participating in the Quit India Movement. He was elected to the
                        Madras Legislative Assembly in 1946 as a Congress party representative. Reddy became the deputy
                        chief minister of Andhra State in 1953 and the first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh in 1956.
                        He was a union cabinet minister under Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi from
                        1964 to 1967 and Lok Sabha Speaker from 1967 to 1969. He later retired from active politics but
                        returned in 1975, responding to Jayaprakash Narayan's call for "Total Revolution" against the
                        Indira Gandhi Government.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Elected to Parliament in 1977 as a candidate of the Janata Party, Reddy was unanimously elected
                        Speaker of the Sixth Lok Sabha and three months later was elected unopposed as President of
                        India. As president, Reddy worked with Prime Ministers Morarji Desai, Charan Singh and Indira
                        Gandhi. Reddy was succeeded by Giani Zail Singh in 1982 and he retired to his farm in Anantapur.
                        He died in 1996 and his samadhi is at Kalpally Burial Ground, Bangalore. In 2013, the Government
                        of Andhra Pradesh commemorated Reddy's birth centenary.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Reddy joined the Indian struggle for independence from the British Raj following Mahatma
                        Gandhi's visit to Anantapur in July 1929 and dropped out of college in 1931. He was closely
                        associated with the Youth League and participated in a student satyagraha. In 1938, Reddy was
                        elected Secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Provincial Congress Committee, an office he held for ten
                        years. During the Quit India Movement, he was imprisoned and was mostly in jail between 1940 and
                        1945. Released in March 1942, he was arrested again in August and sent to the Amraoti jail where
                        he served time with activists T Prakasam, S. Satyamurti, K Kamaraj and V V Giri till 1945.

                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        In 1951, in a closely contested election, he was elected President of the Andhra Pradesh
                        Congress Committee defeating N G Ranga. When the Andhra State was formed in 1953, T.
                        Prakasam became its Chief Minister and Reddy became the deputy.[19] After the later formation of
                        the Andhra Pradesh state by incorporating Telangana with the Andhra State, Reddy became its
                        first Chief Minister[20] from 1 November 1956 to 11 January 1960.[21] He was Chief Minister for
                        a second time from 12 March 1962 to 20 February 1964, thus holding that office for over five
                        years.[22] Reddy was MLA from Sri Kalahasti and Dhone respectively during his stints as Chief
                        Minister. The Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam multipurpose river valley projects were
                        initiated during his tenure.[26] The Government of Andhra Pradesh later renamed the Srisailam
                        project to Neelam Sanjiva Reddy Sagar in his honour.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Congress governments under Reddy placed emphasis on rural development, agriculture and
                        allied sectors.[28] The shift towards industrialisation remained limited and was largely driven
                        by the central government's investments in large public sector enterprises in the state.[29]
                        Reddy's first term as Chief Minister ended in 1960 after he resigned on being elected President
                        of the Indian National Congress. In 1964, he resigned voluntarily following unfavourable
                        observations made against the Government of Andhra Pradesh by the Supreme Court in the Bus
                        Routes Nationalisation case.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        In the general elections of 1967, Reddy was elected to the Lok Sabha from Hindupur in Andhra
                        Pradesh.[35] On 17 March 1967, Reddy was elected Speaker of the Fourth Lok Sabha becoming only
                        the third person to be elected Speaker of the house during their inaugural term. To
                        emphasize the independence of the Speaker's office, Reddy resigned from the Congress
                        Party. His term as Speaker was marked by several firsts including the admission of a
                        No-Confidence Motion on the same day as the President's address to a joint session of
                        Parliament,[15] the handing down of a sentence of imprisonment for Contempt of the house[39] and
                        the setting up of the Committee on the Welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.[15]
                        During his term as Speaker a defamation suit filed against him by an MP resulted in the Supreme
                        Court's ruling that parliamentarians had complete freedom of speech in the House and that the
                        courts had no say in such matters. Reddy described his role as being the 'watchman of
                        the Parliament'.[43] He however had several hostile encounters with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
                        in the House that proved costly when he became, two years later, the Congress Party's nominee to
                        succeed Zakir Hussain as president.
