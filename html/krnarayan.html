                        Born in Perumthanam, Uzhavoor village, in the princely state of Travancore (present day Kottayam
                        district, Kerala), and after a brief stint with journalism and then studying political science
                        at the London School of Economics with the assistance of a scholarship, Narayanan began his
                        career in India as a member of the Indian Foreign Service in the Nehru administration. He served
                        as ambassador to Japan, United Kingdom, Thailand, Turkey, People's Republic of China and United
                        States of America and was referred to by Nehru as "the best diplomat of the country".[2] He
                        entered politics at Indira Gandhi's request and won three successive general elections to the
                        Lok Sabha and served as a Minister of State in the Union Cabinet under former Prime Minister
                        Rajiv Gandhi. Elected as the ninth Vice President in 1992, Narayanan went on to become President
                        in 1997. He was the first member of the Dalit community to hold the post.

                        <br><br><br>
                        Narayanan is regarded as an independent and assertive President who set several precedents and
                        enlarged the scope of the highest constitutional office. He described himself as a "working
                        President" who worked "within the four corners of the Constitution"; something midway between an
                        "executive President" who has direct power and a "rubber-stamp President" who endorses
                        government decisions without question or deliberation.[3] He used his discretionary powers as a
                        President and deviated from convention and precedent in many situations, including – but not
                        limited to – the appointment of the Prime Minister in a hung Parliament, in dismissing a state
                        government and imposing President's rule there at the suggestion of the Union Cabinet, and
                        during the Kargil conflict. He presided over the golden jubilee celebrations of Indian
                        independence and in the country's general election of 1998, he became the first Indian President
                        to vote when in office, setting another new precedent.

                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Narayanan entered politics at the request of Indira Gandhi and won three successive general
                        elections to the Lok Sabha in 1984, 1989 and 1991, as a representative of the Ottapalam
                        constituency in Palakkad, Kerala, on a Congress ticket. He was a Minister of State in the Union
                        cabinet under Rajiv Gandhi, holding the portfolios of Planning (1985), External Affairs
                        (1985–86), and Science and Technology (1986–89). As a Member of Parliament, he resisted
                        international pressure to tighten patent controls in India. He sat in the opposition benches
                        when the Congress was voted out of power during 1989–91. Narayanan was not included in the
                        cabinet when the Congress returned to power in 1991. K. Karunakaran, Congress Chief Minister of
                        Kerala, a political adversary of his[citation needed], informed him that he was not made a
                        minister because of him being a "Communist fellow-traveller[citation needed]". He did not,
                        however, respond when Narayanan pointed out that he had defeated Communist candidates[citation
                        needed] (A. K. Balan and Lenin Rajendran, the latter twice) in all three elections.[18]

                        <br><br><br>

                        K. R. Narayanan was elected as the Vice-President of India on 21 August 1992, under the
                        Presidency of Shankar Dayal Sharma. His name had been proposed initially by V. P. Singh, former
                        Prime Minister and the then leader of the Janata Dal parliamentary party. The Janata Dal and the
                        parliamentary left parties had jointly declared him as their candidate, and this had later
                        garnered support from the Congress under P. V. Narasimha Rao, leading to a unanimous decision on
                        his election. On his relationship with the Left front, Narayanan later clarified[18] that he was
                        neither a devotee nor a blind opponent of Communism; they had known of his ideological
                        differences, but had supported him as Vice-President (and later as President) because of special
                        political circumstances that prevailed in the country. He had benefited from their support, and
                        in turn, their political positions had gained acceptability. When the Babri Masjid was
                        demolished on 6 December 1992, he described the event as the "greatest tragedy India has faced
                        since the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi".[3]

                        <br><br><br>

                        He is the first dalit president of india and the first Malayali person to receive the highest
                        office of the country. He was the first president to vote in the Lok sabha elections and
                        addressed the state assembly.[23]
