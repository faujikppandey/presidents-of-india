                        Sharma was born in the city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.[citation needed] He completed initial
                        schooling from Government Hamidiya Boys school Bhopal. Sharma pursued his higher education at
                        Agra University and University of Lucknow. After earning a doctorate in law at the University of
                        Cambridge, he attended Lincoln’s Inn in London and Harvard University. He was Honored as
                        "Proud Past Alumnus" in the list of 42 members, from Allahabad University Alumni Association,
                        Ghaziabad.

                        <br>

                        During the 1940s he was involved in the struggle for Indian independence from the British, and
                        joined the Indian National Congress, a party which he would remain loyal to for the rest of his
                        life. After India's independence, the Nawab of Bhopal expressed his wish to retain the Bhopal
                        princely state as a separate unit. Sharma led public agitations against the Nawab in December
                        1948, leading to his arrest. On 23 January 1949, Sharma was sentenced to eight months
                        imprisonment for violating restrictions on public meetings. Under public pressure, the Nawab
                        later released him, and signed the agreement for merger with the Indian Union on 30 April
                        1949.[7] In 1952, Sharma became the chief minister of the Bhopal state and was the youngest
                        chief minister then. He served in that position until the state reorganization of 1956, when
                        Bhopal state merged with several other states to form the state of Madhya Pradesh.

                        During the 1960s Sharma supported Indira Gandhi's quest for leadership of the Congress Party. He
                        was elected as the President, AICC in 1972 and presided over the AICC session in Calcutta. From
                        1974, he served in the union cabinet as the minister for Communication from 1974–77. In 1971 and
                        1980 he won a Lok Sabha seat from Bhopal. Later on, he was given a variety of ceremonial posts.
                        In 1984 he began serving as a governor of Indian states, first in Andhra Pradesh. During this
                        time, his daughter Geetanjali Maken and son-in-law Lalit Maken, a young member of parliament and
                        a promising political leader, were killed by Sikh militants. In 1985, he left Andhra Pradesh and
                        became governor of Punjab during a time of violence between the Indian government and Sikh
                        militants, many of whom lived in Punjab. He left Punjab in 1986 and took up his final
                        governorship in Maharashtra. He remained governor of Maharashtra until 1987 when he was elected
                        for a 5-year term as the eighth Vice-President of India and chairman of the Rajya Sabha.

                        Sharma was known to be a stickler for parliamentary norms. He is known to have broken down in
                        the Rajya Sabha while witnessing the members of the house create a din on a political issue. His
                        grief brought back some order into the proceedings of the house. </p>
