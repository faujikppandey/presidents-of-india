                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                        pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the
                        State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his
                        mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu
                        pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam
                        was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had
                        been wealthy traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Their
                        business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri
                        Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a result, the family
                        acquired the title of "Mara Kalam Iyakkivar" (wooden boat steerers), which over the years became
                        shortened to "Marakier." With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however,
                        the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the
                        ancestral home.[19] By his early childhood, Kalam's family had become poor; at an early age, he
                        sold newspapers to supplement his family's income.[20][20][21]

                        <br><br><br>
                        In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking
                        student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially
                        mathematics.[21] After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School,
                        Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated
                        with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22] He moved to
                        Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam
                        was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and
                        threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days.
                        Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under
                        stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream
                        of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were
                        available in the IAF.[24]

                        Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
                        presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by
                        Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.[38]

                        <br><br><br>

                        On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time,
                        expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[39][40] and both the
                        Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.[41][42] After the
                        Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in
                        office, leaving the field clear.[43] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:

                        <br><br><br>

                        I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a
                        message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this
                        juncture.[44]

                        On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee
                        and his senior Cabinet colleagues.[45]


                        <br><br><br>

                        Kalam along with Vladimir Putin and Manmohan Singh during his presidency
                        The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002 in Parliament and the state
                        assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory
                        was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.[46] Kalam became the 11th president of
                        the Republic of India in an easy victory,[47] and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was
                        sworn in on 25 July.[48] Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a
                        Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President. Dr Sarvepalli
                        Radhakrishnan (1954) and Dr Zakir Hussain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who
                        later became the President of India.[49] He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor
                        to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.[50]

                        <br><br><br>

                        During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People's President,[51][52][53]
                        saying that signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his
                        tenure.[54][55][56] Kalam was criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the
                        21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure.[57] Article 72 of the Constitution of
                        India empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death
                        sentence of convicts on death row.[57][58] Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year
                        tenure as president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later
                        hanged.[57] Perhaps the most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was
                        convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced
                        to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.[58] While the sentence was scheduled to be
                        carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining
                        on death row.[58] He also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in
                        2005.[59]

                        <br><br><br>

                        In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of
                        Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping in view the population of the country.[60][61][62][63]

                        At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second
                        term in office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential
                        election.[64] However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential election again
                        stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes.[65]
                        He did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a
                        renewed mandate.[66][67]

                        <br><br><br>

                        Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media
                        reports in April claimed that Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second term.[68][69][70]
                        After the reports, social networking sites witnessed a number of people supporting his
                        candidature.[71][72] The BJP potentially backed his nomination, saying that the party would lend
                        their support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian National Congress proposed
                        him for the 2012 presidential election.[73][74] A month ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh
                        Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also expressed their support for Kalam.[75] Days afterwards, Mulayam
                        Singh Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary supporter.[76] On 18 June 2012,
                        Kalam declined to contest the 2012 presidential poll. He said of his decision not to do so:

                        <br><br><br>

                        Many, many citizens have also expressed the same wish. It only reflects their love and affection
                        for me and the aspiration of the people. I am really overwhelmed by this support. This being
                        their wish, I respect it. I want to thank them for the trust they have in me.[77] </p>
