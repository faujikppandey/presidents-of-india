                A web page is simply a text file. The text file contains text and markup code that specifies what should appear when viewed with a web browser. When you view the page with your web browser, the web browser renders the markup code (it displays as intended), instead of just outputting the code (browsers know to do this). Behind the scenes, the web page looks different to what you see in your browser. When you view the file with a text editor or HTML editor, you'll see the HTML tags (as written by the programmer).
