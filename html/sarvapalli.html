                        Radhakrishnan was awarded scholarships throughout his academic life. He joined Voorhees College
                        in Vellore for his high school education. After his F.A. (First of Arts) class, he joined the
                        Madras Christian College at the age of 17. He graduated from there in 1906, and also finished
                        his Masters the same college.

                        <br>
                        Radhakrishnan studied philosophy by chance rather than choice. Being a financially constrained
                        student, when a cousin who graduated from the same college passed on his philosophy textbooks in
                        to Radhakrishnan, it automatically decided his academic course.[16][17]

                        <br>
                        Radhakrishnan wrote his thesis for the M.A. degree on "The Ethics of the Vedanta and its
                        Metaphysical Presuppositions".[18] It "was intended to be a reply to the charge that the Vedanta
                        system had no room for ethics."[19] Two of his professors, Rev. William Meston and Dr. Alfred
                        George Hogg, commended Radhakrishnan's dissertation.[citation needed] Radhakrishnan's thesis was
                        published when he was only twenty. According to Radhakrishnan himself, the criticism of Hogg and
                        other Christian teachers of Indian culture "disturbed my faith and shook the traditional props
                        on which I leaned."[19] Radhakrishnan himself describes how, as a student,
                        The challenge of Christian critics impelled me to make a study of Hinduism and find out what is
                        living and what is dead in it. My pride as a Hindu, roused by the enterprise and eloquence of
                        Swami Vivekananda, was deeply hurt by the treatment accorded to Hinduism in missionary
                        institutions.[5]

                        <br>
                        This led him to his critical study of Indian philosophy and religion[19] and a lifelong defence
                        of Hinduism against "uninformed Western criticism".[5] At the same time, Radhakrishnan commended
                        Professor Hogg as 'My distinguished teacher,'[20] and as "one of the greatest Christian thinkers
                        we had in India.'[21] Besides, Professor William Skinner, who was acting Principal of the
                        College, gave a testimonial saying "he is one of the best men we have had in the recent years",
                        which enabled him to get the first job in Presidency College. In reciprocation, Radhakrishnan
                        dedicated one of his early books to William Skinner.[22]

                        Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakamu,[note 1] a distant cousin, at the age of 16.[23] As per
                        tradition the marriage was arranged by the family. The couple had five daughters and a son,
                        Sarvepalli Gopal. Sarvepalli Gopal went on to a notable career as a historian. Sivakamu died in
                        1956. They were married for over 51 years.
                        <br>

                        In April 1909, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was appointed to the Department of Philosophy at the
                        Madras Presidency College. Thereafter, in 1918, he was selected as Professor of Philosophy by
                        the University of Mysore, where he taught at its Maharaja's College, Mysore. [web 4][24] By that
                        time he had written many articles for journals of repute like The Quest, Journal of Philosophy
                        and the International Journal of Ethics. He also completed his first book, The Philosophy of
                        Rabindranath Tagore. He believed Tagore's philosophy to be the "genuine manifestation of the
                        Indian spirit". His second book, The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy was published
                        in 1920.

                        <br>
                        In 1921 he was appointed as a professor in philosophy to occupy the King George V Chair of
                        Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta. He represented the University of
                        Calcutta at the Congress of the Universities of the British Empire in June 1926 and the
                        International Congress of Philosophy at Harvard University in September 1926. Another important
                        academic event during this period was the invitation to deliver the Hibbert Lecture on the
                        ideals of life which he delivered at Manchester College, Oxford in 1929 and which was
                        subsequently published in book form as An Idealist View of Life.

                        <br>
                        In 1929 Radhakrishnan was invited to take the post vacated by Principal J. Estlin Carpenter at
                        Manchester College. This gave him the opportunity to lecture to the students of the University
                        of Oxford on Comparative Religion. For his services to education he was knighted by George V in
                        the June 1931 Birthday Honours,[web 5] and formally invested with his honour by the
                        Governor-General of India, the Earl of Willingdon, in April 1932.[web 6] However, he ceased to
                        use the title after Indian independence,[25]:9 preferring instead his academic title of
                        'Doctor'.

                        <br>
                        He was the Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University from 1931 to 1936. In 1936 Radhakrishnan was
                        named Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at the University of Oxford, and was
                        elected a Fellow of All Souls College. That same year, and again in 1937, he was nominated for
                        the Nobel Prize in Literature, although this nomination process, as for all laureates, was not
                        public at the time. Further nominations for the award would continue steadily into the 1960s. In
                        1939 Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya invited him to succeed him as the Vice-Chancellor of Banaras Hindu
                        University (BHU).[26] He served as its Vice-Chancellor till January 1948.


                        <br>
                        Radhakrishnan started his political career "rather late in life", after his successful of his
                        academic career.[5] His international authority preceded his political career. In 1931 he was
                        nominated to the League of Nations Committee for Intellectual Cooperation, where after "in
                        Western eyes he was the recognized Hindu authority on Indian ideas and a persuasive interpreter
                        of the role of Eastern institutions in contemporary society."[5] When India became independent
                        in 1947, Radhakrishnan represented India at UNESCO (1946–52) and was later Ambassador of India
                        to the Soviet Union, from 1949 to 1952. He was also elected to the Constituent Assembly of
                        India. Radhakrishnan was elected as the first Vice-President of India in 1952, and elected as
                        the second President of India (1962–1967).

                        <br>
                        Radhakrishnan did not have a background in the Congress Party, nor was he active in the struggle
                        against British rules. He was the politician in shadow. His motivation lay in his pride of Hindu
                        culture, and the defence of Hinduism against "uninformed Western criticism".[5] According to
                        Brown,

                        <br>
                        He had always defended Hindu culture against uninformed Western criticism and had symbolized the
                        pride of Indians in their own intellectual traditions.[5]

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Teacher's Day</b>
                        <br>
                        When he became the President of India, some of his students and friends requested him to allow
                        them to celebrate his birthday, on 5 September. He replied,

                        Instead of celebrating my birthday, it would be my proud privilege if September 5th is observed
                        as Teachers' Day.[27]

                        His birthday has since been celebrated as Teacher's Day in India.[web 7]
