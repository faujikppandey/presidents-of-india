                        Husain was born in Hyderabad State, into a Pashtun family of the Afridi tribe. His family
                        belonging to Malihabad,which came to be more closely associated with Qaimganj in Farrukhabad
                        district, and education and academia. After Husain was born, his family migrated from
                        Hyderabad to Qaimganj, where he grew up. He was the second of seven sons: the elder brother of
                        fellow educationist Yousuf Husain. Husain's family would remain active in public life: his
                        grandson Salman Khurshid, a Congress politician, is a former Foreign Minister of India, and his
                        nephew was the noted academic Masud Husain.His brother Mahmud Husain joined the Pakistan
                        Movement and served as their Education Minister, while his nephew Anwar Husain was director of
                        Pakistan Television. His relative Rahimuddin Khan served as Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff
                        Committee of the Pakistan Army and as Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

                        <br>
                        Husain's father, Fida Husain Khan, died when he was ten years old; his mother died in 1911 when
                        he was fourteen. Husain's early primary education was completed in Hyderabad, He completed
                        High school from Islamia High School, Etawah, and was then educated at the Muhammadan
                        Anglo-Oriental College, then affiliated with the University of Allahabad, where he was a
                        prominent student leader. He received his doctorate in economics from the University of
                        Berlin in 1926. In 1915, at the age of 18, he married Shah Jahan Begum and had two daughters,
                        Saeeda Khan and Safia Rehman.


                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        When Hussain was 23 years old, with a group of students and teachers he founded the National
                        Muslim University, first founded in Aligarh on Friday 29 October 1920 then shifted to Qarol
                        Bagh, New Delhi in 1925, then later shifted again on 1 March 1935 to Jamia Nagar, New Delhi and
                        named it Jamia Millia Islamia (a central university). He subsequently went to Germany to obtain
                        a PhD from the Frederick William University of Berlin in Economics. While in Germany, Husain was
                        instrumental in bringing out the anthology of arguably the greatest Urdu poet Mirza Assadullah
                        Khan "Ghalib" (1797–1868).[11]

                        <br>
                        He returned to India to head the Jamia Millia Islamia which was facing closure in 1927. He
                        continued in that position for the next twenty-one years providing academic and managerial
                        leadership to an institution that was intimately involved with India's struggle for freedom from
                        the British Rule and experimented with value-based education on the lines advocated by Mahatma
                        Gandhi and Hakim Ajmal Khan.[12] During this period he continued to engage himself with
                        movements for educational reforms in India and was particularly active in the affairs of his old
                        alma mater the Muhammadan Anglo Oriental College (now the Aligarh Muslim University). During
                        this period Hussain emerged as one of the most prominent educational thinkers and practitioners
                        of modern India. His personal sacrifice and untiring efforts to keep the Jamia afloat in very
                        adverse circumstances won him appreciation of even his arch political rivals like Mohammed Ali
                        Jinnah.

                        <br>
                        Soon after India attained independence, Husain agreed to be the Vice chancellor of the Aligarh
                        Muslim University which was facing trying times in post partition India because of active
                        involvement of a section of its teachers and students in the movement for creation of Pakistan.
                        Husain, again, provided leadership during a critical phase of the history of the University at
                        Aligarh from 1948–1956. Soon after completing his term as Vice Chancellor he was nominated as a
                        member of the Upper House of Indian Parliament in 1956, a position he vacated in 1957 to become
                        Governor of the State of Bihar.

                        <br>
                        After serving as the Governor of Bihar from 1957 to 1962, and as the second Vice President of
                        India from 1962 to 1967, Husain was elected President of India on 13 May 1967. In his inaugural
                        speech, he said that the whole of India was his home and all its people were his family.[13]
                        During his last days, the issue of nationalization of banks was being hotly debated. The bill,
                        in the end, received presidential consent from Mohammad Hidayatullah, (acting president) on 9
                        August 1969.[14]
