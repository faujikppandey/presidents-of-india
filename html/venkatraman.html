                        Venkataraman was born in Rajamadam village near in Pattukottai, near Tanjore district in Tamil
                        Nadu in an Iyer family. He had his school education in Govt Boys Higher Secondary School,
                        Pattukottai & Undergraduation in National College, Tiruchirappalli.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Educated locally and in the city of Madras (now Chennai), Venkataraman obtained his master's
                        degree in Economics from Loyola College, Madras. He later qualified in Law from the Law College,
                        Madras. Venkataraman was enrolled in the Madras High Court in 1935 and in the Supreme Court in
                        1951.[4]

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        While practising law, Venkataraman was drawn into the movement for India's freedom from
                        Britain's colonial subjugation. His active participation in the Indian National Congress's
                        celebrated resistance to the British Government, the Quit India Movement of 1942, resulted in
                        his detention for two years under the Defence of India Rules. Venkataraman's interest in the law
                        continued during this period. In 1946, when the transfer of power from British to Indian hands
                        was imminent, the Government of India included him in the panel of lawyers sent to Malaya and
                        Singapore to defend Indian nationals charged with offences of collaboration during the Japanese
                        occupation of those two places. In the years 1947 to 1950, Venkataraman served as Secretary of
                        the Madras Provincial Bar Federation.

                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Law and trade activity led to Venkataraman's increasing association with politics. He was a
                        member of constituent assembly that drafted India's constitution. In 1950, he was elected to
                        free India's Provisional Parliament (1950–1952) and to the First Parliament (1952–1957). During
                        his term of legislative activity, Venkataraman attended the 1952 Session of the Metal Trades
                        Committee of International Labour Organisation as a workers' delegate. He was a member of the
