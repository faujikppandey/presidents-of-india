                        After graduating in law from DAV College, Kanpur, Kovind went to Delhi to prepare for the civil
                        services examination. He passed this exam on his third attempt, but he did not join because he
                        had only scored high enough to work in an allied service rather than in IAS and thus started
                        practising law.
                        <br>
                        Kovind enrolled as an advocate in 1971 with the bar council of Delhi. He was Central Government
                        Advocate in the Delhi High Court from year 1977 to year 1979. Between 1977 & 1978, he also
                        served as the personal assistant of Prime Minister of India Morarji Desai. In 1978, he
                        became an advocate-on-record of the Supreme Court of India and served as a standing counsel for
                        the Central Government in the Supreme Court of India from 1980 to 1993. He practised in the
                        Delhi High Court and Supreme Court until 1993. As an advocate, he provided pro-bono aid to
                        weaker sections of society, women and the poor under the Free Legal Aid Society of New Delhi.[9]

                        and President of the All-India Koli Samaj. He also served as national spokesperson of the
                        party.He donated his ancestral home in Derapur to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Soon
                        after joining the BJP, he contested for Ghatampur assembly constituency, but lost and later
                        contested for Bhognipur (in 2007) (both in Uttar Pradesh) assembly constituency on the BJP
                        ticket but lost again.
                        <br>

                        In 1997, Kovind joined the protest against certain orders from the Central government that had
                        adverse effects on the SC/ST workers. Later, three amendments were made to the Constitution that
                        revoked the orders, by the NDA government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

                        Ram Nath Kovind received 65.65% of the valid votes, against former Speaker of the Lok Sabha -
                        Meira Kumar, the presidential candidate of the Opposition who received 34.35% of the total
                        votes. Kovind received 2,930 votes (From MPs and MLAs) amounting to Electoral College votes of

                        only the second highest for a losing candidate, that of Neelam Sanjiva Reddy in the 1969
                        Presidential elections being the highest ever; he received 405,427 votes as against 420,077 by V
